  <h3>Lost & Found</h3>
  <p>
  Initially, I wanted a more squared ring, which I attempted to create using arcs and lines. However, I encountered difficulties filling the color with this approach, forcing me to change my idea to a more rounded one. When creating the ring in perspective, I realized there were a lot of overlapping ellipses to cover any extra lines. To manage these fills and strokes separately, I used the push() and pop() functions. The most challenging aspect of the project was creating the hole in the middle of the ring. Making sharp corners with ellipse() was not possible, so I had to construct two arcs and carefully align them to make it look like a single shape. I initially experimented with lines to make the heartbeat, but it ended up looking like mountains. Looking at the P5JS references, I decided to utilize the syntax for a Bezier curve. To make sure it was accurate, I drew the heartbeat in Figma and then transferred the anchor point coordinates to match the shape.</p>
