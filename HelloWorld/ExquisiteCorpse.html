  <h3>Exquisite Corpse</h3>
  <p>
    My initial sketch for the exquisite corpse was a robot, Something that looked like it was made of cardboard. I got lucky whith the grouping as the other two sketches were also robots and the exqusite corpse was almost made combining them together.

    I first made the sketch using rectangles and ellipses like all the other assignments. To encoporate user defined functions i made the three parts of the corpse into 3 functions taking colours of the main object as parameters.
    
    These 3 functions were then called in the draw function and combined. After doing this it felt too simple and required the same skill as week 2. So i started to encoporate the explorations i made with music, conditionals and if statements. dances along with it. The robot dances and when the mouse is clicked it starts playing Daft Punk's "Robot Rock" song.
    *It was very direct so mostly covered the steps in the comments on the code*
    
    
    Because of the time constraint we didn't get to make or discuss three different stories but i put together one for the final sketch:
    
    Robot Daft wasn't just any robot. His head was made from an old jukebox that had been abandoned in the junkyard. The body and legs came from two other robots that had been dismantled.
    When Robot Daft was put together, he looked a bit odd. His hands, body and his legs were all rusted so he decided to get a coat of fresh red paint. He loved to dance to Daft Punk (which was the last song played on the jukebox), and he was the best dancer in the junkyard.</p>
