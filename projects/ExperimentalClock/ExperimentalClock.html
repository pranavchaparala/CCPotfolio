        <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
        <p>
            Addressing the myth around death being predetermined by the number of breaths. This experimental clock measures the passage of time based on the user's mood and breath rate.

        </p>
        <p>
            When the user is happier times seem to pass faster, making their breath rate tends to increase. Conversely, when the user is sadder, their breath rate may slow down, creating a perception of time moving more slowly.
        </p>
        <p>
            By connecting the subjective experience of time with a fundamental biological process, this clock offers a unique and personalized way to measure the passage of time.

            I have used map() & max() functions from references.
I had one major error with declaring bodycolor variable and broke the code, Searching it on google said i need to declare it outside setup.
