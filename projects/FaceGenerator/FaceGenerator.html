        <h3>REFLECTIONS</h3>
        <p>
            I initially began with a simpler face design for part 1, but I was too limited and needed a different idea. Inspired by Van Gogh's "The Scream," I chose this painting because it conveys emotions, even in a still painting.
        </p>
        <p>
            wanted the face color to remain the same, unlike the examples, so I intended to use the random function and change the background color on mouse press. However, I accidentally discovered a flickering effect that I found to be cooler. Therefore, I decided to keep the background color flickering and instead change the dress color with a mouse click.

            I used mouseX and mouseY to track the mouse's position and adjust the size of the mouth and eyes. I tried to use if-else logic to restrict the size, but it didn't work. So, I searched the p5 references and found the map function to limit the mouse position and prevent the eyes from exceeding 30 pixels. I still don't fully understand how it works, but through trial and error with the syntax, I ensured there was no overlap.

        <p>
            I have used map() & max() functions from references.
I had one major error with declaring bodycolor variable and broke the code, Searching it on google said i need to declare it outside setup.
