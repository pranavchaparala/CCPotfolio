        <h3>REFLECTIONS</h3>
        <p>
            I looked up for minimal illusions and most of them were 3D cubes or lines which i was not sure if i can make. So i decided to to make a 2D one which makes it 3D with movement.
        </p>
        <p>
           
            I found an illusion which was just simple circles being offsetted and similary another rose which looked like a rose from top because of the fill. I managed to make something very similar to these like a ripple but it started breaking my browser or went filling the entire frame orange. I had to chatGPT the loop section to see how i can reverse it and make it a seamless loop.

            By connecting the subjective experience of time with a fundamental biological process, this clock offers a unique and personalized way to measure the passage of time.

        </p>
        <p>
            
The code it gave broke the illusion but created a separate variable which increments and another one which reduces the circle. So tried out the same. After trial and error making changes to the incriments it ended up working well.
