        <h3>REFLECTIONS</h3>
        <p>
            Initially, I wanted a more squared ring, which I attempted to create using arcs and lines. However, I encountered difficulties filling the color with this approach, forcing me to change my idea to a more rounded one.
        </p>
        <p>
          When creating the ring in perspective, I realized there were a lot of overlapping ellipses to cover any extra lines. To manage these fills and strokes separately, I used the push() and pop() functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most challenging aspect of the project was creating the hole in the middle of the ring. Making sharp corners with ellipse() was not possible, so I had to construct two arcs and carefully align them to make it look like a single shape. I initially experimented with lines to make the heartbeat, but it ended up looking like mountains. Looking at the P5JS references, I decided to utilize the syntax for a Bezier curve. To make sure it was accurate, I drew the heartbeat in Figma and then transferred the anchor point coordinates to match the shape.
