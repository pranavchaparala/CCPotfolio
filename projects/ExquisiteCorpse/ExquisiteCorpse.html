        <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
        <p>
            Robot Daft wasn't just any robot. His head was made from an old jukebox that had been abandoned in the junkyard. The body and legs came from two other robots that had been dismantled.
            When Robot Daft was put together, he looked a bit odd. His hands, body and his legs were all rusted so he decided to get a coat of fresh red paint. He loved to dance to Daft Punk (which was the last song played on the jukebox), and he was the best dancer in the junkyard.
